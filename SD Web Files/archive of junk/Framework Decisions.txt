# What framework do I like/need?

## Bootstrap

### Things I'd like
- Base CSS
	- buttons, maybe
	- typography
- Components
	- navbar
	- buttons
	- alerts (use for errors and success)
	- progress bars, maybe
- Javascript Plugins
	- modals (for alerts, or help?)
	- tooltips (maybe for explanations of voltage, etc.)
	- buttons w/ loading state (for ajax saving of data)
- LESS
	- only maybe useful for customizing CSS colors, etc.

### Things I don't want
- janky grey input styling and bulkiness

## FontAwesome
- for slick icons for buttons, really classes up the joint
