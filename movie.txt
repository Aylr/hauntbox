# Intro
1. Hi
2. I am Tom
3. I am Taylor
4. and we are the designers of the HauntBox
5. [lightning/logo]

What is the hauntbox?
6. What is the HauntBox?
7. The HauntBox is an 
8. [words pop up on screen]
open source
Arduino based
hardware
sensors
actuators
programmable  logic
input platform to make doing 

##Why
9. Why did we make the HauntBox?
10. to bridge the gap between the world of Arduino microcontrollers that require programming knowledge with with people who want to control things and trigger sound effects easily,
11. without tedious programming
we wanted to be able to easily trigger sound effects, props and lighting.. all without tedious coding and specialized knoweledge.

## Macro / How
11.1 How does it work?
12. 
- a system of parts
- Sensors and peripherals plug into your hauntbox and the hauntbox plugs into your network.
- then simply open a browser and set an instruction like this:
	- For example, 
		- When a motion is sensed in my room, wait 2 seconds then turn the lamp on for 20 seconds.
- This can of course be done from any smartphone, tablet, iPad or computer on your network.

### HauntBox / Micro
13. now that you've seen how easy it is to configure, let's take a look at the components
14-16. [words and titles appear over drawing]
The HB has
and ethernet port, power plug, SD card, and screw terminals for easily connecting and changing the inputs and outputs without any nasty soldering
It is compatible with 5, 12, and 24V inputs/outputs for maximum flexibility and compatibility with your existing devices.  
The inputs and outputs are clearly labeled and each have LEDs that show their status
All of this, wrapped in a conveniently mountable protective enclosure...
For you open-source hackers, it has unused header pins to accept Arduino shields.

### Inputs
17. What about the inputs?

#### PIR
18 Our favorite input is a infrared motion sensor whose custom designed housing will be manufactured on cutting-edge, open-source, 3D printers like the Maker Bot [bing?]
This manufacturing technology enables us to get these into your hands by avoiding a huge investment in injection molding tooling. [with machine audio]
19. our unique mounting design allows for mounting on any surface [show wall mount]
20/21. and for more weather resistant applications, it can be mounted inside a 2 inch ABS pipe fitting

22. Add a section of pipe as a shroud to narrow the beam

23 Can also be used with other inputs like

- Magnetic reed switch
- push button [zombie hand push]
- floor mat switch [zombie foot]
26. [Sensor universe screen]
 -toggle switch
 -break-beam sensor
- push button
- toggle switch
- reed switch
- pressure pad
- 
- ball switch

### Outputs
27. What about outputs?

28. Our favorite output stems from our frustration of trying to incorporate triggered sound without crappy CD kloooges 

we wanted something as simple as throwing some audio files onto an SD card, sliding it into the module, and having it work.
So in the true open-source spirit, we designed an all-in-one, Arduino compatible sound module based on the amazing work of Lady Ada
31. [picture of Lady Ada with angelic “Ah”]

32. [Big words appearing on screen:]  The sound module:
	- plays optional background ambient track
	- play a single triggered sound
	- or a shuffle sounds
	All with no programming whatsoever

33. The HB outputs can also drive relays for controlling your props or other devices
	- wiper motor or creepy crawler lady
	
35. Solenoids
	[something with compressed air?]
	-air muscle
	
34. 120V AC devices using a Power Tail
[something happening in background, not sure what it is]
[shows peoples' feet scurrying in background]

36. [universe of possibilities] or any other device as limited by your imagination
	- fog machine
	- strobe light

## Exploratory Applications Demo/Review
37. [background/foreground talking heads]
In summary, the HauntBox is a browser-configured sensor actuated prop controller that brings sound and automation to your creations all without needing a computer science degree.

## Why we need your help
41. Here is why we need your help

42. [panning over prototypes]
We have spent the last year designing and prototyping and with your help we can complete the SW engineering and 
turn these proven prototypes into an affordable finished product through custom manufacturing

tahnks for you time and pelase consider pledgeing to make the hauntbox a reality
