## Intro

What is the hauntbox?
- 

Why did we make the HauntBox?
- to bridge the gap between the world of Arduino microcontrollers that require programming knowledge with th
- and sound

## Macro
- a system of parts
- the core/soul/body/brain is a unified device that plugs into you network to control....
- the brain takes inputs and based on your rules/program/thingies controls the outputs
- GUI demo of one line of program. This can of course be done from any computer, tablet, iPad or smartphone.

## Micro

### Hauntbox
- now that you've seen how easy it is to "control"... 
- ethernet, power
- screw terminals avoid any nasty soldering and make lighting quick changes
- handles standard 5/12 with the option of 24V power inputs/outputs
- clearly labeled with indicator LEDS when an input/output is active
- all wrapped in a conveniently mountable protective enclosure...

### Inputs
- PIR, housing
	- wall mount
	- shroud vision changer
	- ABS option
- Magnetic door switch
- push button
- pressure pad

### Outputs
- low power devices using relays
	- wiper motor
- high power devices (120V) PowerTail
	- fog machine
	- strobe light
- solenoid
- Sound module
	- with no programming whatsoever
	- play optional background ambient track
	- play a single triggered sound
	- or a shuffle sounds
	- simply by uploading files to an SD card

## Exploratory Applications Demo
- a few 5 second vignettes to show functionality, sequential cascade and sound to show 1 input is not bound to 1 output. 
- prop showing all outputs

## Open Source

## Why we need your help
- to get the custom PCBs made and fabricated,
