# Manufacturer Bare Metal Testing Procedure

## Updated 5/31/13 15:16

This is the procedure for testing Hauntbox boards from the bare metal off the assembly line. *This is not intended for normal users.*

## Things you'll need:

- an AVRISP mkII programmer ($35)
- a hauntbox
- a microUSB cable
- a 12V power supply
- a wired ethernet connection for the Hauntbox. **DHCP** must be running on your network or you need to set a [static IP][https://github.com/Aylr/theHB/wiki/_preview#static-ip-address-use-only-if-you-dont-have-dhcp-on-your-network].
- a working installation of the Arduino IDE (from http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- software libraries discussed below

## Bootloader

Using Arudino IDE 1.0.2

1. Plug in AVRISP mkII to ICSP header port
2. Tools > Board > Arudino Mega 2560 or Mega ADK
3. Tools > Programmer > AVRISP mkII
4. Tools > Burn Bootloader (This should take a minute or more)

## Firmware

### Required Arduino libraries

- Ethernet library from Arduino (included in the IDE)
- SD library (included in the IDE)
- EthernetBonjour library https://github.com/neophob/EthernetBonjour
- TinyWebServer https://github.com/ovidiucp/TinyWebServer
- Flash (required by TinyWebServer) http://arduiniana.org/libraries/flash/

Installation instructions are found here: http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

### Hauntbox Firmware & Installation

Again, using Arduino IDE 1.0.2

1. Plug in micro USB to Hauntbox and USB to computer
2. Download the SD Web Files folder from our github at https://github.com/Aylr/theHB
3. Put all the **contents of that folder** (not the folder itself) onto the root directory of an empty, formatted SD card
4. Insert that SD card into your hauntbox (or arduino if your are bringing your own hardware)
5. Download the file **Hauntbox_Firmware.ino**
6. Open the file **Hauntbox_Firmware** with the Arduino IDE
7. In the Arduino program: File > Upload. This compiles the firmware and updates your Hauntbox (or arduino).

## Testing

1. Plug the Hauntbox into your network with an ethernet cable. Pleas
2. Power the Hauntbox with a 12V power supply via the black power jack
3. You should see the following LEDs turn on:
	- Power (red)
	- Inputs 1-6 (green)
	- Outputs A-F (green)
	- Various network LEDs on the CAT5 jack and hauntbox (green and yellow)
4. Open the Arudino > Tools > Serial Monitor. Set the baud rate to 115200. You should see the following:
	- "Starting up Hauntbox. Free RAM: nnnn KB"
	- "Setting up SD card..."
	- "Setting up the Ethernet card..."
	- "Web server starting..."
	- "Ready to accept web requests at http://hauntbox.local or at http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" (the IP address assigned by your network's DHCP) 
5. At this point you should see all the input & output LEDs go off indicating a ready state.
6. Open your browswer (on the same network) and go to http://hauntbox.local
7. Wait approximately 30 seconds for the page to load. The first load is slow while the browser prepares the front end.
8. Navigate to the **override** page.
9. Turn all outputs ON. All output LEDs should turn on.
10. Turn all outputs OFF. All output LEDs should turn OFF.

### Static IP address (use only if you don't have DHCP on your network)

If you do not have a network with DHCP, which is fairly uncommon, or if you want your hauntbox to have a static IP address do the following:

1. Using a text editor (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, nano on Linux) make a new text file called **ip.txt**. This file should have a static ip in the format of "192.168.1.1" on the first line and nothing else.
2. Put the file **ip.txt** on the SD card of the hauntbox.
3. Put the SD card back into the hauntbox
4. Reset the hauntbox.
