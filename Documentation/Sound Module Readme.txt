# Hauntbox Sound Module Instructions

<a href="http://hauntbox.net"><img src="http://hauntbox.net/storage/remotelogo/hblogo.png"></a>

- The sound module can operate in a few modes depending on your wishes.
- Normally, the sound module loops your "ambient.wav" sound file until it is triggered on either of the trigger screw terminals.
- When triggered, it will play a single .wav file.
- If you have multiple files, it will keep track and play the next numbered file on the next trigger.
- Want to mix it up? Make a file called "random.txt" on the SD card
- **ALWAYS reset your sound module after inserting an SD card**

## The files

- **ambient.wav**: This is the optional background ambient noise/music/etc you want looped. Want silence between triggers? delete this file.
- **trigger sounds**: You can have up to **30** sounds named numerically from "0.wav" to "29.wav"
- **random.txt**: If you create a file named "random.txt" and put it on the SD card whenever you trigger the module a random trigger sound will be played.

## Sound File Details

- The hauntbox sound modules requires .wav files. These can be generated from many programs including Audacity (audacity.org), iTunes (apple.com/itunes), and many other sound editing programs.
